Yesterday, project DeepWiki was published by <https://cognition.ai>. It is such an amazing AI tools which we think it will change the way how engineer teams build the documentation for their project.

We already triggered it to index [github.com/open3fs/m3fs](https://github.com/open3fs/m3fs) project, and it generated correct and comprehensive documentations. Especially, the overview page is remarkable, it will give you all you need including architecture diagrams and some key information in table form.

Try it by yourself: [deepwiki.com/open3fs/m3fs](https://deepwiki.com/open3fs/m3fs).
