title: "M3FS Add Grafana Integration For Monitoring"

---

m3fs add Grafana integration in the release v0.1.9.

## How Does It Work

m3fs now will pull Grafana (version 12.0.0) images and setup a Grafana service with a 3FS dashboard automatically.

By default, Grafana service will listening on TCP port **3000**, and the default username and password are all **admin**. The Grafana service started by m3fs contains a ClickHouse data source and a dashboard. After launching a cluster with m3fs, you can visit the Grafana service's URL (e.g. http://ip:3000) to monitor the running of the 3FS cluster. Take a look at the dashboard:

## The 3FS Metrics

### Type of Metrics

3FS calculates metrics in each service and store metrics to ClickHouse through monitor service. There are some types of metrics in 3FS, and the metric may or may not be reset after each report.

There are many types of metrics:

| Type | Class | Storage Table | Description |
|------|-------|---------------|-------------|
| value | `ValueRecorder` | 3fs.counters | Set by code and stored to ClickHouse directly. E.g. capacity |
| count | `CountRecorder` | 3fs.counters | Increase by code and usually reset to zero after each report. E.g., report read counter every second mean read IOPS.<br><br>It is also be used to track current on-flight operations, which is increased at the beginning and is decreased after the operation finished, rather than reset automatically after report. |
| distribution | `DistributionRecorder` | 3fs.distributions | Used to calculate P90, P99 and etc for the period between two reports. |
| latency | `LatencyRecorder` | 3fs.distributions | Special distribution implementation, record latency with unit ns (nanosecond). |

### List of Metrics

Following is a partial list of the metrics and their meanings:
